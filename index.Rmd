# Static website

A general-purpose (static) [website built with R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html#site_authoring) and the `blogdown` package.

- A prototype; it could also be deployed in Bitbucket or GitLab.
- A test bench for htmlwidgets and a framework for integrating interactive packages.
    - It is rather cumbersome to deploy widgets in other websites. 
    - The widgets have to generate an HTML fragments and the later are then embedded into a webpage.
- A notebook: a vade mecum on random topics.

# Deploying an R Markdown website

![](img/blogdown.png){ width=0.6in align=left hspace=10px }
We can learn the [basics](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html#overview) of the `blogdown` package for developing web content with or without RStudio using R Markdown and publishing it in a static website for free on GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab. Other hosting services, such as Amazon S3, are super cheap. Here is a complete [list](http://alignedleft.com/resources/cheap-web-hosting). We can also deploy a blog. Consult this [short book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) on using R Markdown and Hugo.

## Hosting

- [GitHub starting point](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).
- [Bitbucket doc](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/publishing-a-website-on-bitbucket-cloud-221449776.html).
- [GitLab doc](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/index.html) and [tutorial](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/04/07/gitlab-pages-setup/).

## Icons

We can fetch icons like the ones in the menu from different websites.

- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/).
- [ionicons](http://ionicons.com/).
- [Glyphicons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/).

Set prefix: e.g., `fa-github`, `ion-social-twitter`, `glyphicon-time`.

## Caching

Enable knitr caching during the development of the site. Rapidly preview changes. Just add the `cache = TRUE` chunk option.

## The `htmltools` package

As an alternative to RStudio, we can generate custom HTML from R code using the `htmltools` package.

## Tables

There are a variety of ways to generate HTML tables, including the `knitr::kable` function (Markdown output) and the `xtable` package (HTML output).

# Books

We can also write [book with R Markdown]( https://bookdown.org/).
